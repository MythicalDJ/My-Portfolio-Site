				<h2>About The Project</h2>
				<div class="about-content">
					<div class="about-text">
						<p>
							This project is an algorithmic stock trading algorithm developed as a personal endeavour to
							explore algorithmic trading. The system is built upon the Pybroker framework and is written
							in Python.
							This program also integrates into the Alpaca API to fetch market data and also will be able
							to execute trades.
							Use of the Pybroker framework allows for machine learning and data analysis to be
							implemented into the program.
							This project is still very much a work in progress and is still under development.

							goals.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature-item">
						<i class="fas fa-database"></i>
						<h3>Data Integration</h3>
						<p>Integrates with various APIs to fetch real-time market data and historical prices.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature-item">
						<i class="fas fa-calendar"></i>
						<h3>Backtesting</h3>
						<p>Utilises the power of Pybroker to backtest an algorithm with historical data to evaluate its

					</div>
					<div class="feature-item">
						<i class="fas fa-brain"></i>
						<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
						<p>Utilising Pybroker's backtesting and "walkforward analysis" to train a model on historic data
							to evaluate its performance on data it has not yet seen.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature-item">
						<i class="fas fa-chart-area"></i>
						<h3>Visualisation</h3>
						<p>Uses Matplotlib to visualise the performance of the algorithm and a portfolio over time in

				<h2>Review</h2>
				<h3>What I've Learned So Far</h3>
				<p>
					This project has given me the opportunity to improve my python programming skills, a language I
					hadn't
					touched since GCSE, and learn how to work with API's, libraries and frameworks.

					It has also given me a better understanding of algorithmic trading and has taught me some of the
					basics of
					machine learning.
				</p>
				<h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
				<p>
					Learning how to use frameworks has been a challenge, especially with PyBroker. Not only is it new to
					me, but it's also written in a language I haven't used in a while. On top of that, the entire
					premise of algorithmic trading is inherently complex, involving advanced mathematics and statistics.
				</p>
				<h3>Future Improvements</h3>
				<p>
					I am currently undergoing a rewrite of what I have done so far to use more Object-Oriented
					Programming principles, improving its robustness, making it easier to read, as well as increasing
					scalability.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p> After the rewrite, I plan to work on creating more advanced machine learning features as the current
					algorithm, which is built upon a simple linear regression model, is limited. After creating a profitable
					model and strategy in backtesting scenarios, I then hope to add functionality for the program to be
					able to live trade by making use of the Alpaca API.</p>

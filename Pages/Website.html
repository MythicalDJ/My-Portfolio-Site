							<p>
								This portfolio website was built from scratch
								using only HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript.
								Avoiding unnecessary complexity by opting to use
								just the fundamental web technologies, has
								allowed me to create a website that is both
								visually appealing and functional in a short
								time period.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								I created this site page by page. Using the
								landing page as a template for the rest of the
								pages. Re-using the same CSS and JavaScript and
								just tweaking the colour scheme or adding a new
								feature. I figured that the dark mode pages on
								needed some more visual interest, so I drew
								inspiration from
								<a href="https://weekendlabs.net/"
									>Weekend Labs</a
								>
								and added a dash of colour to the edge of the
								page.

							<p>
								Creating this website was a fun endeavour as I
								haven't worked with HTML or designed any websites
								since it came up in the A-Level computer science
								syllabus.
							</p>
							<p>
								Not all was smooth sailing however, as I had to
								partially re-learn how to use HTML. And how to
								use CSS to create a website design that I was
								happy with. I often found myself researching how
								to create certain elements such as the cards
								that are found throughout the website.
							</p>
							<p>
								One issue I ran into during the development of
								the site was that when a user first opens one of
								the project pages. The videos which are played
								in the hero, had not been fetched and displayed
								in time, ruining the experience for the user. To
								fix this I loaded these videos whilst the user
								was on the landing page, so that they would be
								stored in their cache for when they opened the
								project pages.
